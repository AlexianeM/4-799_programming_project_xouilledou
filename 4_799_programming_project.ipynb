        "# **Digit warrior: beat the machine!**\n",
        "\n",
        "This project was imagined and implemented by Alexiane Maillard, Business Administration student at the University of St.Gallen.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Concept of the project\n",
        "This project is a Python project where a small game was implemented. \n",
        "The game is called *Digit warrior: beat the machine* and is about a contest between the user and a machine. The user is shown an image of a handwritten digit (between 0 and 9, coming from the scikit-learn *digits* dataset) and must guess what number is written. Against him/her is a machine, a k-Nearest-Neighbors model, which has been trained to predict the number shown in the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Main components of the project\n",
        "1. `machine_creation()` function: In this function, a supervised ML model for digit prediction is created. The k-Nearest-Neighbor was used due to the satisfying model accuracy it provided (around 96%). The hyperparameter k was set to 3 after tuning (hyperparameter tuning done with a for-loop and several values for k, then deleted in the project below to only keep the final value, this to ensure smooth code in 1 cell), because it delivered the most satisfying model accuracy while not being too small (which would represent an overfitting danger). Finally, this function returns the digits dataset, the trained model and the model accuracy. The first two returned values are used in the `play_guess_number_game(dataset, knn_model)` function, the model accuracy is used in the game explanations from the `main()` function.\n",
        "2. `user_input_btw_0_9`function: since the user must enter a number between 0 and 9 (included) when he plays the game, this function was defined to make sure that the input is valid, i.e. that it is an integer (or can be converted into an integer without causing a ValueError) between 0 and 9. As long as the user input is not valid, the user is asked to enter a new input. This function returns the user input, certified valid. The returned input is used in the `play_guess_number_game(dataset, knn_model)` function.\n",
        "3. `play_guess_number_game(dataset, knn_model)` function: this function computes the actual game. It takes two arguments, both coming from the returned values of the `machine_creation()`funciton. As long as the user wants to play, it randomly selects and shows him a handwritten digit as an image to the user. On one side, it uses the user input computed in the previous function. On the other side, it uses the digit label predicted by the model (defined in the first function) and compares it with the user input. Then, it prints who was right and adjusts the user and the machine's scores accordingly. It prints both scores and asks if the user wants to play again (if yes, the while-loop of the function continues).\n",
        "4. `main()` function: this function is the \"display\" function. It shows the game title and explanations and calls the previously defined functions when required. This function is then called following Python best practices.\n",
