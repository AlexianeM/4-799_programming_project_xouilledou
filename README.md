**Digit warrior: beat the machine!**

This project was imagined and implemented by the person with pseudo Xouilledou, Business Administration Bachelor student at the University of St.Gallen.

## Concept of the project
This project is a Python project where a small game was implemented. 
The game is called *Digit warrior: beat the machine* and is about a contest between the user and a machine. The user is shown an image of a handwritten digit (between 0 and 9, coming from the scikit-learn *digits* dataset) and must guess what number is written. Against him/her is a machine, a k-Nearest-Neighbors model, which has been trained to predict the number shown in the image.

## Document details
The project is contained in a Python Notebook (.ipynb). All the code is in the same cell (so the document could have been a Python script), and the project details as well as explanations about its different components are explained. The project can be run on VS Code, Google Colab, Anaconda (and Jupyter Notebooks), or on other IDEs.
